## What is it?

## How do I use it?
### New/Steam Users
* Simply download the game on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/352700/Subspace_Continuum) and enable the **Beta** release.
### Legacy Users
* Download the latest official release from [here](https://github.com/purge-dev/ContinuumRPC/releases).
* Unzip the contents into your main Continuum folder, overwriting your Continuum.exe (you can make a backup if you wish).
* Run the game as usual. Any existing shortcuts/launch options you made will still work, and all game platforms on **Windows** are supported. This may also work in **MacOS** and **Linux** using [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) (untested).
